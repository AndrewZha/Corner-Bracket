# CornerBracket
Colorado Early Colleges Fort Collins commissioned corner bracket piece for easy-up shades. 

Easy-up tent shades are used frequently by CECFC as a station for many purposes involving activities outside. One of the corner pieces suffered from irreparable damage and needed to be replaced, so I was commissioned to create a 3D model for the corner pieces. All modeling was done in SolidWorks, and the 3D print was done using Ultimaker 3 from Cura. Some troubleshooting for the 3D printer was needed.
